## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This exercise consists of creating a class named `Persona` with the attributes: `name`, `surname`, and `age`. 
Then, you must create a class called `GenericMethods` that contains a **generic method** capable of accepting three parameters of any type.

The generic method should simply print out the values it receives.

In the `main()` method of the main class, the generic method should be called with different types of arguments to demonstrate that:
- The method accepts any type of parameter.
- The parameters can be passed in any order.

> 🧪 Example usage: a `Persona` object, a `String`, and a primitive type like `int`.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 8 or higher (any JDK version 5+ will work)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code / Command Line
- JDK distributions (e.g., OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, Temurin, etc.)


## 📋 Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 5 or newer
- Compatible with any standard JDK distribution:
  - OpenJDK (recommended)
  - Oracle JDK
  - Eclipse Temurin
  - Amazon Corretto
  - Zulu OpenJDK

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.
3. Ensure your JDK is set up and configured correctly.

in bash: 
-git clone https://github.com/your-repo/GenericMethods.git
-cd GenericMethods

## ▶️ Execution

Compile the Java files:

in bash:
-javac Persona.java GenericMethods.java Main.java
-java Main

## 🌐 Deployment

This is a basic console-based exercise and does not require deployment. 
It can, however, be reused in more complex systems that involve generics or utility methods.
